 * Phase 2 spike — the authoritative op loop (PROPOSE §7, the load-bearing seam).

 *   1. allow-list the op TYPE (11 wire ops; excluded types never reach reduce),
 *   2. version-gate EDIT_STORY (reject if written against a stale version),
 *   3. apply via plan's EXISTING pure reducer (imported, never re-implemented),
 *   4. guard with plan's EXISTING validatePlan,
 *   5. commit transactionally BEFORE the caller acks/broadcasts.
 *
 * Everything other than the EDIT_STORY gate converges under arrival order +
 * validatePlan; that is the entire net-new rule the spike adds.
